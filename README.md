## Managing Projects

The [`projects.json`](./src/data/projects.json) file located in the [`src/data`](./src/data/) directory plays a key role in managing the projects showcased on your portfolio website. Here's an in-depth guide on how to effectively update and manage this file.

### Structure of [`projects.json`](./src/data/projects.json)

The JSON file is structured as an array of objects, each representing a project. Below is a detailed description of each field within a project object:


```json
{
  "name": "The name of the project",
  "type": "The type of project (e.g., Design Studio, Research) - must be one of predefined enum values",
  "year": "The year the project was completed or published",
  "description": "A short description of the project",
  "longDescription": "A more detailed description of the project",
  "href": "A URL link to more details about the project or an external site",
  "video": {
    "src": "URL to a video showcasing the project",
    "alt": "Alternative text for the video"
  },
  "location": {
    "name": "Name of the location relevant to the project",
    "url": "Optional URL providing more details about the location"
  },
  "group": ["Array of strings used to tag or categorize the project"],
  "awards": [
    {
      "name": "Name of the award",
      "url": "URL to the award description",
      "img": "URL to an image of the award"
    }
  ],
  "publications": [
    {
      "name": "Name of the publication",
      "url": "URL to the publication",
      "img": "URL to an image of the publication cover"
    }
  ],
  "bentoAttributes": {

      "name": "Name of a tutor or mentor involved in the project",
      "url": "URL to tutor's professional profile"
    }
  ],
  "images": [
    {
      "src": "URL to an image associated with the project",
      "alt": "Alternative text for the image",
      "className": "CSS class for styling the image",
      "href": "Link to the source of the image",
      "caption": "Caption for the image",
      "credit": {
        "text": "Text crediting the source of the image",
        "url": "URL to the source of the image"
      },
      "isHero": "Boolean indicating if this is the main image for the project",
      "isAdaptive": "Boolean indicating if the image is adaptive",
      "isCarousel": "Boolean indicating if the image should be included in a carousel",
      "isExternal": "Boolean indicating if the image is from an external source",
      "isVideo": "Boolean indicating if the image is actually a video thumbnail"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Adding a New Project

To add a new project, simply append a new object to the array in [`projects.json`](./src/data/projects.json) using the schema provided above. Ensure all required fields are included to maintain site functionality.

## Managing Profile Information

Profile information is managed through the [`profile.json`](./src/data/profile.json) file located in the [`src/data`](./src/data/) directory. This file is structured as a single JSON object representing your personal or professional profile.

### Structure of [`profile.json`](./src/data/profile.json)

Here‚Äôs what each field should contain:

```json
{
  "name": "Your full name",
  "about": "A brief introduction or biography",
  "image": {
    "src": "Path to your profile picture",
    "alt": "Alternative text for the profile picture"
  },

    "Relevant keywords to your profession or skills (This will be displayed as rotating text on the homepage)"
  ],

  "social": {
    "instagram": "URL to your Instagram profile",
    "github": "URL to your GitHub profile",
    "youtube": "URL to your YouTube channel"
  },
  "contact": {
    "email": "Your email address",
    "phone": "Your phone number"
  }
}
```

## Navbar

If for reasons you want to change the navbar links, you can do so by modifying the [`navbar.json`](./src/data/navbar.json) file located in the [`src/data`](./src/data/) directory. The file is structured as an array of objects, each representing a link in the navbar.

```json
[
  {
    "title": "Section 1",
    "url": "/#section-1",
    "id": "section-1"
  },
  {
    "title": "Section 2",
    "url": "/#section-2",
    "id": "section-2"
  }
]
```

## Images

Images are stored in the [`public`](./public/) folder. You can replace the images with your own images. Make sure to update the image paths in the [`projects.json`](./src/data/projects.json) file.
