## Managing Projects

The [`projects.json`](./data/projects.json) file located in the [`./data`](./data/) directory plays a key role in managing the projects showcased on your portfolio website. Here's an in-depth guide on how to effectively update and manage this file.

### Structure of [`projects.json`](./data/projects.json)

The JSON file is structured as an array of objects, each representing a project. Below is a detailed description of each field within a project object:

```yaml
- projects (array of objects, required)
  [
    - id (string, required)
    - name (string, required)
    - type (string, required)
      - Enum: ["Design Studio", "International Competition", "Design Studio / Research", "Research", "Research Assistanship"]
    - year (string, required)
    - description (string, required)
    - longDescription (string, required)
    - location (object, required)
      - name (string, required)
      - url (string, optional)
    - group (array of strings, optional)
    - awards (array of objects, optional)
        [
          - name (string, required)
          - url (string, optional)
          - img (string, optional)
        ]
    - publications (array of objects, optional)
        [
          - name (string, required)
          - url (string, required)
          - img (string, optional)
        ]
    - gallery (object, required)
      - className (string, required)
    - tutors (array of objects, optional)
        [
          - name (string, required)
          - url (string, required)
        ]
    - mediaContainer (object, required)
      - className (string, optional)
      - media (array of objects, optional)
          [
            - src (string, optional)
            - alt (string, optional)
            - className (string, optional)
            - credit (object, optional)
              - text (string, optional)
              - url (string, optional)
              - isButton (boolean, optional)
            - sizes (string, optional)
            - caption (object, optional)
              - text (string, optional)
              - isExpose (boolean, optional)
            - blurDataURL (string, optional)
            - isHero (boolean, optional)
            - isAdaptive (boolean, optional)
            - isCarousel (boolean, optional)
            - isExternal (boolean, optional)
            - isInverted (boolean, optional)
            - isVideo (boolean, optional)
          ]
  ]
```

### Notes

- The schema uses draft-07 of JSON Schema.
- Additional properties are not allowed in the project objects.
- The `location`, `gallery`, and `mediaContainer` objects are required for each project.

### Adding a New Project

To add a new project, simply append a new object to the array in [`projects.json`](./data/projects.json) using the schema provided above. Ensure all required fields are included to maintain site functionality.

## Managing Profile Information

Profile information is managed through the [`profile.json`](./data/profile.json) file located in the [`./data`](./data/) directory. This file is structured as a single JSON object representing your personal or professional profile.

### Structure of [`profile.json`](./data/profile.json)

Here‚Äôs what each field should contain:

## üèóÔ∏è Structure
```yaml
- Profile object
  - name (string, required)
    - Description: A brief description of yourself.
  - about (string, required)
    - Description: A brief description of yourself.
  - image (object, optional)
    - src (string, required)
    - alt (string, optional)
  - keywords (array of strings, required)
  - slogan (string, required)
  - social (object, required)
    - instagram (string, optional)
      - Format: URI
    - github (string, optional)
      - Format: URI
    - youtube (string, optional)
      - Format: URI
  - contact (object, required)
    - email (string, optional)
      - Format: email
    - phone (string, optional)
```
### Notes
- The schema defines a single object with multiple properties.
- Required fields: `name`, `about`, `social`, `contact`, `keywords`, and `slogan`.
- The image object is optional, but if present, it must have a 'src' property.
- Social media links and contact information are structured as nested objects.
- All social media links should be valid URIs.
- The email field, if provided, should be in a valid email format.

## Images

Images are stored in the [`public`](./public/) folder. You can replace the images with your own images. Make sure to update the image paths in the [`projects.json`](./data/projects.json) file.
